### Lab 1.1 Getting started

#### Let's learn how to create and manage a Python virtual environment.

A **`venv`** is a *self-contained Python environment* that has its own:

- Python interpreter
- Installed libraries
- Scripts

It’s isolated from the global Python on your system.

#### Why is it useful?

1. Avoid conflicts: Different projects may need different versions of the same library. With `venv`, each project has its own environment.
2. Safe testing: You can test or install new packages without messing up your main Python setup.
3. Cleaner setup: Keeps your system Python clean — no clutter from random packages.
4. Reproducibility: Easier to recreate the exact same environment on another machine (using `requirements.txt`).

#### Part A. `venv`

1. Create a virtual environment named `test`.

```bash
python -m venv test
```

> **Note:**
> Depending on how Python is installed on your system, you may need to use `python` or `python3` in the command line. Likewise, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

2. Activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system.

- **Windows (CMD)**:

  ```bash
  test\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:

  ```bash
  .\test\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

- **macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source test/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install a simple library (e.g., `requests`).

```bash
pip install requests
```

4. List installed libraries.

```
pip list
```

5. Exit the virtual environment.

```bash
deactivate
```

6. Re-enter it later:

(Repeat step 2 activation)

7.  Delete the virtual environment,

```bash
rm -r test       # macOS/Linux
rd /s /q test    # Windows CMD
Remove-Item test -Recurse -Force  # Windows PowerShell
```

> **Note:**
> You should create a **new virtual environment (venv) for each project**.
> This keeps project dependencies separate and avoids conflicts between different libraries or versions.

### Part B `requirements.txt`

1. `requirements.txt`. it's just a text file that lists all the Python packages your project needs.

2. Example requirements.txt:

   ```python
   requests
   flask
   numpy==1.24.0
   ```

> **Note:**
> Each line is one library (you can even specify exact versions, like `numpy==1.24.0`).

3. If you already installed packages and want to save them.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

> **Note:**
> This will write all installed packages into the file.

4. When someone else (or you later) wants to install everything.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(`-r` means "read from a file".)

5. Typical use of `venv` and `requirements.txt`.

* You create a virtual environment (`venv`).
* You install the needed libraries.
* You save the environment to `requirements.txt`.
* You can share it with others or recreate it easily!

#### Part C: Let's put everything together!

Complete the following task.

1. Create a new folder for a project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Open a new terminal.
4. Create a virtual environment called `my-test-venv`.
5. Activate the virtual environment.
6. Install the `pandas` library using the command `pip install pandas`.
7. Save all installed libraries into a file called `requirements.txt`.
8. Deactivate the virtual environment.
9. Reactivate the virtual environment.
10. Deactivate and delete the folder.
